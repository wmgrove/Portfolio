  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <p>I'm Wesley Grove, a senior at Indiana University - Kokomo, graduating with honors in May 2023 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. I also mentor high school  robotics, specifically FRC Team 45, the TechnoKats, which I am an alumni of. With this team, I have been nominated for the Woodie Flowers award by the students on the team, an award that each team nominates a mentor for who they feel best embodies the values of FIRST. Furthermore, I have presented computer science research with Professor Awny Alnusair at both the IUK Research Symposium, and the Indiana University Undergraduate Research Conference (IUURC), and the research was accepted for the National Conference of Undergraduate Research (NCUR). I also am President of the IUK Computing and Programming Undergraduates Club (CPU Club) at IUK, and was nominated for IUK Student of the month for October 2022.</p>
